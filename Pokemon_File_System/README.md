## Instructions

If you wanna transfer a pokémon from game A to game B you have to make sure that both games uses the same environment. For example if a pokémon is inside a "Cheese Ball" and it is trasfered to game B, game B should have the same ball, otherwise the game will crash. Same thing for pokémons, moves, ribbons and items in general.

For v19.1 usage: delete the "Essentials" line in the `meta.txt` file.

`PokemonFile_Scene` manages the animations for export and import (only for Essentials v20.1).

Check `settings.rb` for configuration.
