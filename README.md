Repository with plugins I made/reworked for Pokémon Essentials.
</p>

## General instructions
1. Download the plugin.
2. Extract the content of the downloaded .zip inside "Plugins" folder.
3. All plugins have individual instructions in the `README.md` file, so make sure to follow them as well.
4. Recompile the game by holding CTRL button while starting the game in debug mode.

## Informations
- Old Essentials versions are not supported. All the plugins will be updated only for the latest Essentials version.
- About the categories:
  - Utility:
    - Focused on code;
    - Used for define mechanics or add functionalities.
  - Gameplay:
    - Focused on game;
    - Used to improve the player experience. 

## Objectives
These are the main things I keep in mind when writing scripts:
- Modularity: a plugin should be safely deleted without compromise other stuff in the project;
- Vanilla: a plugin should be made with vanilla essentials methods;
- Plug and play: a plugin should be easy to install.

Complex plugins may not satisfy these objectives though.
